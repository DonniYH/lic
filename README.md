# Lic

Lic has aged poorly; it has a few fundamental flaws running through its core that would require an almost complete rewrite in order to fix.  I started it when I was still in university and didn't know any better.  And distributing a python based desktop application is very frustrating.  And there are no unit tests of any kind.

For those reasons, this project is no longer maintained.  Instead, I have begun a complete rewrite, this time as a web / browser based application.  [Web Lic](https://github.com/remig/web_lic) is still in is infancy, but it's evolving a hundred times faster than old & busted Lic ever did.  See you there.
